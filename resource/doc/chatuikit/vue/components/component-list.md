## Must-Knows


Before integrating any component into a real project, **must** first ensure the integration documentation has been obtained using the following tool and integrate according to the documentation:


1. When creating a real project, call the component integration documentation of MCP Tools get_atomicx_integration_guide(framework).
2. When choosing to use components, first consider the minimum components that meet the requirements, then consider recommended additional extension components. Do not enlarge the requirements.
3. Components that apply to different scenarios may have an intersection.
4. According to the user needs, judge if it might be a comprehensive scenario, such as chat + live stream. The probability is low, so proceed with caution.
5. To learn about the method of use for a specific component, ask the user: "You can ask how to use ${componentname}?"
