Must-Knows


1. When receiving user needs, the response should be divided into two parts: the first part is the minimum components to meet the requirements, and the second part is the recommended additional extension components. Do not enlarge user needs.
2. Components for different scenarios have intersection.
3. Determine if it might be a comprehensive scenario according to user needs, such as chat + live stream, with low probability. Proceed with caution.
4. To learn about the method of use for specific components, ask the user: "You can ask how to use ${components[0].name}?"
5. When creating a real project, call MCP Tools get_component_detail ${integration} integration guide of components
