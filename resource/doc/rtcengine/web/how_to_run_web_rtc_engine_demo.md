> **Important Notes:**
>
> - To deploy to the public network for experience, you need to access it through HTTPS protocol, that is, `https://domain/xxx`. For the reason, please refer to the document [Page Access Protocol Restriction Description](./tutorial-05-info-browser.html#h2-3).
> - Currently, the desktop Chrome browser supports TRTC Web SDK's related features more completely, so it is recommended to use Chrome browser for experience, please refer to the document [Browser Compatibility Information](./tutorial-05-info-browser.html#h2-2).
> - The correct way to generate UserSig is to integrate the UserSig calculation code into your server and provide an interface for the App. When you need UserSig, your App sends a request to the business server to obtain a dynamic UserSig. For more details, please refer to [Generating UserSig on the Server](https://trtc.io/document/35166?platform=web&product=rtcengine&menulabel=coresdk).
